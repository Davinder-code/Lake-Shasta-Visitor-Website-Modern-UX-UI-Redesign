## Shasta Lake Tourism Website Redesign
Human-Centered Design Project — Team Collaboration

This project was created for my Human-Centered Design course, where our goal was to redesign an outdated website using real HCD principles such as user research, personas, problem identification, prototyping, and user testing. My team and I selected the Shasta Lake tourism website because the original page was extremely cluttered, visually outdated, and hard for visitors to use.

## Our final redesigned website:
https://mhildebrandt28.wixstudio.com/my-site-3

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to redesign ShastaLake.com by applying Human-Centered Design methods.
From our research and analysis, we learned that the original site suffered from:

Overloaded information with no clear structure

Too many links scattered everywhere

Poor visuals and no scenic photos

Broken/dead links

No mobile optimization

Confusing navigation menus

These findings are fully described in our project documents and presentation.

## Human-Centered Design Process We Followed
1. Problem Identification

Our team carefully analyzed the old Shasta Lake website and identified the major issues:

cluttered layout

unnecessary personal images

long scrolling pages

outdated visuals

lack of proper categories

inconsistent navigation


Project Final Report

2. User Personas

We created three personas to understand different user needs:

Jake (Family Vacationer) – needs quick info for planning family trips

Mike (Adventurer/Photographer) – wants fast access to trails & scenic spots

Kim (Retiree) – prefers simple navigation with larger fonts


CS Presentation Slides.

These personas helped us design for real people, not assumptions.

3. Comparative & Non-Comparative Research

Our team compared the old site to the National Park Service website because it is well organized and user-friendly for tourists.
We also reviewed a non-comparative site (Bicycle Warehouse) to understand clean layout and menu structure.

4. Design Solutions

We redesigned the site with a focus on:

Clear and simple navigation bars

High-quality scenic images to highlight Shasta Lake

Fewer pages with grouped content

Removing personal photos and unnecessary info

Mobile-responsive design

Cleaner interface and modern layout


CS Presentation Slides.

5. Prototype Creation

We built the prototype using Wix Studio, designing a clean homepage with categories such as:

Camping

Lodging

Trails

Fishing

Contact Us

We also added improved visuals, icons, and better structure.


Project Final Report

6. User Testing

We tested our prototype with 8 participants, aged 26–52.
Participants completed tasks like:

Finding campsites

Finding types of fish in summer

Finding paddleboard rental companies

Results showed major improvements in:

Usability

Visual appeal

Efficiency of navigation

Participants on desktop rated the site highest, while mobile testers noted minor scaling issues — giving us feedback for future iterations.

My Contributions

As part of the team, I worked on:

Writing the introduction, project intention, and persona section

Helping identify key problems in the original site

Contributing to layout ideas for the redesigned pages

Assisting with writing the report and slide content

Participating in testing and feedback review



This project reflects both teamwork and my personal experience as a Computer Science / Data Science student working on real user-centered design problems.

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice:

Human-Centered Design process

UX/UI principles

Website structure and navigation planning

Identifying user needs using personas

Collaboration in a design team

Communicating findings through presentations and reports
